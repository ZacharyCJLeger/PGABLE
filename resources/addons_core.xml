  <summary>A Matlab Geometric Algebra tutorial prototype system, find companion tutorials at: https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/l.dorst/GABLE/index.html</summary>
  <description>This toolbox is intended to introduce you to the basic geometric elements of our 3D Geometric Algebra 
(vectors, bivectors and trivectors) and introduces its three basic products:
the outer product, the inner product and the geometric product. 
Also the geometry of Geometric Algebra is implemented: projection, rejection, reflection and rotation.
Amongst much more functionality and features, also quaternions are naturally subsumed within our space.</description>
